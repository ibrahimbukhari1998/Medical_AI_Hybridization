# Medical_AI_Hybridization

We aim to assist Doctors, Radiologists, and technicians to perform their job
much more efficiently by Integrating AI Solution to recognize various disease just form
scanning and analyzing the X-ray and MRI reports. This will help provide a second opinion
from an Fine Tuned Machine Learning Model which will be able to analyze any abnormalities in the
reports.

Our secondary task is to iron out any inconsistencies in the typical Medical Software models
which dampen the efficacy of any medical professional. So, a synchronous workflow can
be produced which is able to handle high volume of patients and the unpredictability that
ensues with such a volume. We hope to integrate all the Various modules such that all the extra
manual work which takes up unnecessary time can be automated.
